# Task Completion Checklist

## When Completing Any Development Task

### 1. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Check TypeScript types
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 2. Test Changes Locally
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test the functionality in browser
# Check console for errors
# Verify responsive design
```

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Ensure production build works
npm run build

# If build succeeds, optionally test production build
npm start
```

### 4. Before Committing
- Review all changed files
- Ensure no console.log statements left in production code
- Check for any hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Verify no sensitive information is exposed
- Make sure TypeScript types are properly defined

### 5. Git Workflow
```bash
# Check what changed
git status
git diff

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat/fix/chore: descriptive message"

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

### 6. Post-Deployment Verification
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Visit production URL to verify changes
- Test critical user flows
- Check browser console for errors

## Common Issues to Check

### TypeScript
- [ ] No `any` types used
- [ ] All props have proper type definitions
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)

### React/Next.js
- [ ] Proper use of Server vs Client components
- [ ] No missing dependencies in useEffect
- [ ] Proper key props in mapped components
- [ ] Error boundaries where needed

### Performance
- [ ] Images optimized (use Next.js Image component)
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Code splitting considered

### Security
- [ ] No API keys or secrets in code
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] XSS prevention (React handles most cases)
- [ ] CORS properly configured for APIs

## Missing Infrastructure (To Be Added)
Currently, the project lacks:
- Automated testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
- E2E testing (Cypress, Playwright)
- Formatting tools (Prettier)
- Pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- CI/CD pipeline beyond Vercel auto-deploy

When these are added, update this checklist accordingly.
